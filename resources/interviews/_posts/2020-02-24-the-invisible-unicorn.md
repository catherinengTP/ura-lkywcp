#### **What were some of the key considerations in the design of Seoullo 7017?**

**Winy Maas (WM):** The Mayor of Seoul wanted to make Seoullo 7017 as something more than the High Line in New York. He wanted something more contextual and unique for Seoul, rather than a direct copy. With this in mind, we designed a linear park and a plant library in an almost barcode-like fashion that allow the citizens of Seoul to experience the variety of greenery that is laid out from A to Z in the Korean alphabet. 

Secondly, our design is intended to be fine-grained and intimate, and to respond well to the urban conditions around it. The urban furniture, kiosks, cafes, stairs and bridges have been carefully planned according to contextual urban thinking. 

Furthermore, we carried out a broader urban analysis about how the sky garden can relate to the neighbourhood on a larger scale. We envision the new Seoullo 7017 as a starting point to connect existing public spaces and green areas in the vicinity, so as to make the neighbourhood greener. The result is a network of parks the size of Central Park in New York.

#### **What are some elements of the design that reflect Seoul? Was this an important consideration?**

**WM:** The Mayor wanted to make Seoullo 7017 as something more than the High Line in New York. He wanted something more contextual and unique for Seoul, rather than a direct copy. With this in mind, we designed a linear park and a plant library in an almost barcode-like fashion that allow the citizens of Seoul to experience the variety of greenery that is laid out from A to Z in the Korean alphabet.

The result is a network of parks the size of Central Park in New York. 

#### **What were some of the challenges with the design of the sky garden?**

**WM:** Unlike New York’s High Line, we could not simply cover the existing highway with earth to create a linear garden, as the structure was not stable enough. As a result, we spent a significant portion of the budget in strengthening and preserving the structure. Even after the reinforcements, we found out that we were still not able to cover it with earth.

#### **How were these challenges overcome?**

**WM:** With the constraints, we decided instead to use flower pots. To create a unified visual identity, we used only round pots and structures that are also multi-functional. The basic pot is one where you can sit on its wide edge. We have also designed round structures functioning as trampolines, cafes, watch-towers, a stage as well as other urban furniture. 

I am proud of the outcome of the project as well as the enthusiastic spirit that the city and participants have showed during the construction process and after. The biggest compliment to an architect and planner is that the end-users are happy with the product and they seem to be. With one million visitors a month, there are lots of activities taking place while a group of volunteers help maintain the plants. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
