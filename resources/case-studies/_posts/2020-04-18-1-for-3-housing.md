#### **In brief**

- A plan to repurpose and redistribute New York City (NYC)’s road spaces to walking, biking and new public spaces, while calming traffic and improving safety. 
- Part of [PlaNYC](http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc/downloads/pdf/140422_PlaNYCP-Report_FINAL_Web.pdf)’s vision to encourage active living, reduce carbon emissions and create more walkable communities. 
- The [NYC Plaza programme](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/nyc-plaza-program.shtml) led by [NYC Department of Transportation (DOT)](https://www.dot.ny.gov/index) converts underutilised road spaces into vibrant neighbourhood amenities/plazas by partnering local non-profit organisations and communities.
- Times Square is most visible example, transformed almost overnight and with little expense from a place dominated by cars to one visited by hundreds of thousands of people daily.

#### **Key issues faced before the implementation of the project**

- Increasing population in the city – projected increase of 1 million people by 2030. 
- Congested, poorly designed, and visually unappealing streets and sidewalks in Times Square.
- The need to improve cyclists’ and pedestrians’ safety.

---

#### **Leadership and governance**

- New plaza sites are nominated through a community-based process and selected by the city. 
- The sites are then planned and designed by the city in consultation with the community. 
- The city funds the construction and partners not-for-profit organisations to maintain the spaces.
- The city further supports plaza partners through supplementary activities such as “[Weekend Walks](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/weekendwalks/html/home/home.shtml)" and public art installation.

#### **Creativity and innovation**

- Instead of developing new sites, public spaces are reclaimed from existing infrastructure – a significant shift in the allocation and prioritisation of public spaces. 
- Sections along Broadway are reclaimed to create “instant public plazas” using paint, planters and seating – an effective and low-cost way to test public responses before longer-term plans. 
- The NYC Plaza Programme aims to ensure all New Yorkers live within a 10-minute walk of a park by 2030. It is cost effective, supports social gathering, increases sense of place and enhances pedestrian movement and safety.
- A detailed study demonstrated the plazas’ benefits and enabled them to become a permanent feature of NYC. 
- Statistical data from before and after the implementation of protected bike paths proved their safety and played a large role in the success of NYC’s bicycle plan. 
- Innovative treatments used such as protected bicycle paths between curbs and parking lanes, high-visibility green bicycle lanes, bike boxes and intersection markings, and redesigned bicycle racks. 
- Partnering non-profit groups is a hallmark of the programme and redirects plaza resources to areas with strong local support.

- Pedestrian volume in Times Square increased by 11%, injuries to motorists and passengers decreased by 63% with and pedestrian injuries decreased 35%. 
- Several new flagship stores opened in Times Square, with the average asking rent increased by 71% since 2009 despite a severe economic downturn.
- Commuter cycling increased by more than 45% from 2006-2009, with decrease in cycling accidents.
- 70% of theatre-goers at Times Square found the plazas having a positive impact on their experience; 74% of New Yorkers agreed that Times Square has improved dramatically since the plaza was redesigned; and 42% of New Yorkers in Times Square have shopped in the neighbourhood more often since the changes.
- In line with NYC’s Bike Master Plan, 50 bicycle lane miles will be installed each year until the citywide 1,800 bicycle-lane mile network is complete in 2030.

#### **Replicable ideas**

- Many cities face similar constraints as NYC, i.e. dense population and built-up infrastructure with minimal available land for new roads or public spaces.
- NYC’s experiences offer replicable ideas, e.g. audits of current conditions, community outreach, and using temporary and inexpensive pilots to test new ideas. 
- Implementation of public plazas and a comprehensive bicycle network influenced cities from Baltimore to Berlin, São Paulo and Sydney. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
