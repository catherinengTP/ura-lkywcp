#### **World Cities Summit, Singapore International Water Week and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore rescheduled to 20 – 24 June 2021**

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the organisers of the World Cities Summit (WCS), Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore (CESG) have been monitoring the situation closely. 

The safety and well-being of our participants and our wider communities are our first priority. With COVID-19 declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation, Singapore and countries worldwide have implemented various restrictions, including on travel and large-scale events. Based on these considerations, we have taken the collective decision to reschedule the three events to 20 – 24 June 2021. 

Despite the rescheduling of WCS, SIWW and CESG, we will continue to work with strategic partners, business leaders, governments and delegates around the world to discuss challenges, opportunities and share best practices for developing more resilient, sustainable and liveable cities. We also thank our stakeholders for their unwavering support in making the three events possible in the past, and look forward to their continued participation to drive the sustainability agenda.

For any questions, please get in touch with us at (email). For the latest developments on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore, please visit the Singapore’s Ministry of Health’s website .

Thank you.
